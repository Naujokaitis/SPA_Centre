SPA Centre. SPA Centre has branches in different towns. Thus, not all services and deals are the same. The park has different ticket prices based on hours, day of the week, season, and age. Visitors can buy short term and long term tickets (one-day ticket, monthly ticket, etc.) Also, the price depends on the chosen services. SPA Park also has treatment services, e.g. massages, halotherapy. But some services are allowed only if the doctor prescribes. Visitors can choose treatment program and the period of a visit. Some treatment procedures are for groups (e.g. halotherapy) while some are individual.
